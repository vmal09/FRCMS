Flood Relief Management System

Overview

Heavy rain and flooding that have affected thousands in Peninsular Malaysia, (in specific Kedah, Malacca, Negeri Sembilan, and Selangor States as well as Kuala Lumpur Federal Territory) causing flash floods and mudflows, resulted in several damages and evacuations. 
According to the National Disaster Management Administration (NADMA), an estimated 6,241 families and 23,776 people have been affected by the floods. 
Victims took shelter at dozens of relief centers in Malaysia's east coast states as heavy flooding continued to inundate villages and block roads. 
Malaysian Red Crescent Society (MRCS) are providing medical and humanitarian support by conducting relief and recovery operations, such as distribution of food items, first aid kits, hygiene kits and providing psychosocial care to affected families. Relief centers hold compartments for each family acting as an enclosed space to rest and recuperate. Forms will be given to fill up personal particulars. Then, available compartments are assigned to registered families after verification.

Problem Statement

Malaysian Red Crescent Society (MRCS) resources management should be facing difficulties providing equal and efficient services, considering the vast number of victims. 
Pen-and-paper registration forms are filled in manually, raising the likelihood of human error and take a long time to complete, may include illegible handwriting, wrong calculations and different types of mistakes. 
Additionally, waste a lot of time in manual data entry. Paper forms have hidden costs. Printing, transporting, and storage costs all add up, not to mention time gathering, uploading and analyzing information. 
Communication seems not very efficient due to the crowded and rushing environment at relief centers populating desperate victims finding service providers, resulting in delayed assistance.



Proposed Solution

A web-based application. in many ways provides functional attributes, acting as a medium for victims to manage their needs and requirements while taking shelter at a relief center. 
Victim family’s leaders are required to register an account to declare their necessities online to ensure crucial services can be delivered orderly and as soon as possible because various communities from different age groups are depending on it. 
Moreover, administration can be highly functional, structured and well organized. The management will have the details of all victims and their requirements under their watch. Hence, assistance is to be provided at a reasonable timespan. 
Web application online forms help to gather and submit data in real-time so they can instantly share it with the main office or service providers in other departments or locations. Hence, making the data collection, as well as submission immensely faster. 
Other than that, using online forms, management can automatically update spreadsheets with pre-submitted data, and data from the field can be submitted at the click of a button using a laptop/mobile device and organization can reduce the number of errors substantially.
